* Increase brigtness of your computer using command line/file in ubuntu 14.04
  + I needed this when suddenly keys controlling the brigtness of my
    machine stopped doing so.
  + Brightness is stored in Ubuntu(any linux) in the form of a value in a file.
  + By chaning the value, one can increase or decrease the brightness.
  + File which stores the brightness value is 
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
    #+END_SRC
    If you the see the content of this file, you will get an integer value.
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    $ cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
      450
    #+END_SRC
  + By changing this value to greater or lesser number you can control your brightness
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    echo 400 > /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
    #+END_SRC
  + The maximum allowed value of brightness is stored by the file 
    #+BEGIN_SRC command
    cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness 
    #+END_SRC
