* Introduction to Virtualization ?

** What is Virtualization ??
   Virtualization is a combination of software and hardware
   engineering that creates Virtual Machines (VMs) - an abstraction of
   the computer hardware that allows a single machine to act as if it
   where many machines.
  

** What is without Virtualization ??

** How does Virtulization make Life@DataCentres easy ??


** Why Virtualization  
   + Reduced cost
   + Easier backup and disaster recovery 
   + Efficient IT Operations
   + Less Heat
   + Easy migrations 
   + Run multiple difference OS on a single machine 

** Lets understand the difference

** Types of Virtualization
*** On the basis of activity 
   + Storage Virtualization 
   + Compute Virtualization 
   + Network Virtualization 
*** On the basic of type 
   + Bare metal - type 1 virtualization
   + OS level -   type 2 virtualization 
*** On the basis of operational way
   + VM based virtualization
   + Container based Virtualization


** Examples Virtualization technologies  
   + VM based virtualization ::
     Citrix, VM Ware, Oracle Virtual Box
   + Container based Virtualization  ::
     Docker, OpenVZ, LxC

* Introduction to Cloud Computing ?

** What is Computing ??

   Computing is the process of manipulation/caculation.  2+2 is
   computating/computaiton. That's what computers do.
   
** What is Cloud ??
   "The Cloud" or "The Network Cloud" is an IT infrastrucuture sitting
   somewhere which contains compute resources like servers, storage,
   network, memory etc.

** What is Cloud Computing ??
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers,
   storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more—over
   the Internet (“the cloud”).

** What without Cloud computing ??
   + No Google Drives
   + No Dropbox, Instagram, 
   + Weak IT Operations -

** Advantages of Cloud computing ??

** Three layers of Cloud Computing or three platforms of cloud computing 
*** IaaS - Infrastrucuture as a Service 
*** PaaS - Platform as a Service 
*** SaaS - Software as a Service 

** Well known Cloud service provider 
   + AWS - Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud
