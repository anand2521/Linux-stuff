* What are we going to learn today ??
  + Basics of Virtualization and Cloud Computing 
  + Setting up our own Dropbox - The ownCloud
  + Setting up our on Cloud service 
  

* What do you need ??
  + System with atleast 4 GB RAM
  + Ubuntu 14.04 OS 
  + Minimum 100 GB of Hard disk 
  + Basic knowledge working on Ubuntu 14.04 or any linux 
  + Editor like vim or vi or gedit
 

* Introduction to Virtualization ??

** What is Virtualization ??
   Virtualization is a combination of software and hardware
   engineering that creates Virtual Machines (VMs) - an abstraction of
   the computer hardware that allows a single machine to act as if it
   where many machines.
  

** What is without Virtualization ??

** How does Virtulization make Life@DataCentres easy ??


** Why Virtualization  
   + Reduced cost
   + Easier backup and disaster recovery 
   + Efficient IT Operations
   + Less Heat
   + Easy migrations 
   + Run multiple difference OS on a single machine 


** Lets understand the difference

** Hypervisors - Virtual Machine Monitors 
  The hypervisor (also called a virtual machine monitor) is the
  low-level program that allows multiple operating systems to run
  concurrently on a single host computer.

*** Type of hypervisor
   + type 1 virtualization - Bare metal or Native Hypervisor 
   + type 2 virtualization - Hosted Hypervisor
  
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   | S.No | Bare Metal                                                       | OS level                                        |
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   |    1 | Directly installed in Hardware                                   | Installed and runs on host Operating System     |
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   |    2 | The hypervisor is small as its main task is sharing and          | OS manages the resource allocation              |
   |      | managing hardware resources between different operating systems. |                                                 |
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   |    3 | A major advantage is that any problems in one virtual machine    | Independent of VM                               |
   |      | or guest operating system do not affect the other guest          |                                                 |
   |      | operating systems running on the hypervisor.                     |                                                 |
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   |    4 | Any issue in hypervisor will destroy the full VMs running in it  | Any issue with OS will destroy all the VMs      |
   |      |                                                                  | hosted on it                                    |
   |------+------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------|
   |    5 | Examples - VMware ESXi Server, Microsoft Hyper-V,                | Examples VMware Workstation,  Microsoft Virtual |
   |      | Citrix/Xen Server                                                | PC, Oracle Virtual Box                          |

** Types of Virtualization
*** On the basis of activity 
   + Storage Virtualization 
   + Compute Virtualization 
   + Network Virtualization 

*** On the basis of operational way
   + VM based virtualization
   + Container based Virtualization


** Examples Virtualization technologies  
   + VM based virtualization ::
     Citrix, VM Ware, Oracle Virtual Box
   + Container based Virtualization  ::
     Docker, OpenVZ, LxC


** Problem Solved -- No way

* Introduction to Cloud Computing 

** What is Computing ??

   Computing is the process of manipulation/caculation.  2+2 is
   computating/computaiton. That's what computers do.
   

** What is Cloud ??
   "The Cloud" or "The Network Cloud" is an IT infrastrucuture sitting
   somewhere which contains compute resources like servers, storage,
   network, memory etc.

** What it is not ??
 [[./images/cloud-what-it-is-not.png]]


** What is Cloud Computing ??
   Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—servers,
   storage, databases, networking, software, analytics and more—over
   the Internet (“the cloud”).


** What without Cloud computing ??
   + No Google Drives
   + No Dropbox, Instagram, 
   + Weak IT Operations -
    

** Advantages of Cloud computing ??


** Three layers of Cloud Computing or three platforms of cloud computing 
*** IaaS - Infrastrucuture as a Service 
*** PaaS - Platform as a Service 
*** SaaS - Software as a Service 

    
** Well known Cloud service provider 
   + AWS - Amazon Web Services, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud


** Types of Cloud
   + Public Cloud :: AWS, Digital Ocean, Microsoft Azure
   + Private Cloud :: Enterprise Cloud
   + Hybrid Cloud :: Mix of Public and private cloud
