* Virtualization
** Why do we use Virtualization ? 
1. Reduce power consumption and air conditioning needs.
2. Trim building space 
3. Run multiple machines in a single physical machine.
4. Run multiple operating systems on single operating systems.

5. Easy backups and recovery
6. Maximum utilization of hardware resources

** What is Virtualization ?
   Virtualization is a combination of software and hardware engineering that
   creates Virtual Machines (VMs) - an abstraction of the computer hardware that
   allows a single machine to act as if it where many machines. \\

Well known examples of Virtualization
+ Disk partition  

** When to use Virtualization ? 
Most of the points mentioned in the section =Why= are good enough to 
show when to use virtualization.
+ In your desktop, you want to run one OS over other
+ You want to create simple cloud cluster in your machine.
+ Test your application in different system environments.

** How to implement Virtualization ? 
This needs technical understanding and expertise.  

*** Scenarios 
+ I want to run Linux over Windows or vice versa.
+ I have a Powerful server machine with 6 TB HDD and 128 GB of RAM. But that is
  underutilized.

*** Hypervisors 
An important software which allows Physical machines to share their resources
among virtual machines 
+ Type 1 Hypervisor ::
It is also called Bare metal hypervisor. \\ 
\\
/Examples - Microsoft's Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer, Wind River, OpenSolaris, and VMware's ESX/

+ Type 2 Hypervisor ::
Also called hosted hypervisor. It is installed above an existing 
OS. \\
 \\
/Examples - Parallel Inc.'s Virtuozzo, Sun VirtualBox, MEDV, Microsoft Virtual PC, VMWare Workstation/

** Story
There was a time when each citizen(the OS) of the city(the Datacenter) was
roaming around and doing his business in his own car (the physical
server). Most of the cars were some big SUVs with big engines, consuming too
much and offering too much space and power than what one person would need. One
day, some smart guys (IBM) decided it will be much more efficient to put all
those citizens in a bus(host physical server) driven by an experienced
driver(the hypervisor); there they can share the power of the big engine, the
storage space and they can talk to each other faster.
