* Introduction
  + Ansible is a configuration management and provisioning tool.
  + It uses SSH to connect to servers and run the configured Tasks.
  + Without a lot of extra coding, bash scripts are usually not safety
    run again and again. Ansible uses "Facts", which is system and
    environment information it gathers ("context") before running
    Tasks.
  + Ansible uses these facts to check state and see if it needs to
    change anything in order to get the desired outcome. This makes it
    safe to run Ansible Tasks against a server over and over again.
