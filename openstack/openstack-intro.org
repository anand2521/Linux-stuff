* Introduction
  + OpenStack is a collection of open source technologies delivering a
    massively scalable cloud operating system
  

* Why do someone need it ???
  + We are going to build our own IaaS cloud and offer it to customers.
  + To acheive this, we would need the following features ::
    + Allow application owners to register for our cloud services,
      view their usage and see their bill.
    + Allow Developers/DevOps folks to create and store custom images
      for their applications.
    + Allow DevOps/Developers to launch, monitor and terminate
      instances.
    + Allow the Cloud Operator to configure and operate the cloud
      infrastructure.

* Conceptual Architecture of Openstack
  Given below is the conceptual architecture of Openstack which is
  designed on the basis of roles, users

  + There are four set of users (developers, devops, owners and operators/admins)
  + Each category is expecting some functionality of their interest.
  + Presentation Layer ::
    + Components interact with users to present information or accept it.
    + It contains web portals, GUI for developers and non-developers. 
  + Logic Tier ::
    + Provides intelligence and control functionality for cloud. 
    + Orchestration , scheduling,  policy, image registry, logging. 
  + Compute ::
    + Actual compute like network, storage etc.
    + It includes servers, switches, network attached storage.
  + Management ::
    + This is to operate the environment.
    + It can include an API to access the cloud admin features and monitoring.
