* Introduction
  + OpenStack is a collection of open source technologies delivering a
    massively scalable cloud operating system
  

* Why do someone need it ???
  + We are going to build our own IaaS cloud and offer it to customers.
  + To acheive this, we would need the following features ::
    + Allow application owners to register for our cloud services,
      view their usage and see their bill.
    + Allow Developers/DevOps folks to create and store custom images
      for their applications.
    + Allow DevOps/Developers to launch, monitor and terminate
      instances.
    + Allow the Cloud Operator to configure and operate the cloud
      infrastructure.
